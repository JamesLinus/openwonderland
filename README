# Build instructions and notes

This is an early attempt to move the [Open Wonderland](http://openwonderland.org/) sources to github
after the announcement that Google code is closing.

## Forking and cloning

There are two main projects, [Open Wonderland](https://github.com/josmas/openwonderland) and [Open Wonderland Modules](https://github.com/josmas/openwonderland-modules). If you want to make your own changes to the code, I would suggest forking and cloning your own repos.


If all you want is to run the code locally you can do the following:

1) clone the main project and it will create a folder called _wonderland_:

    git clone git@github.com:josmas/openwonderland.git wonderland

2) clone the modules project and it will create a project called _openwonderland-modules_:

    git clone git@github.com:josmas/openwonderland-modules.git

3) move into the modules project and create a soft link to the 0.5 folder:

    cd openwonderland-modules
    ln -s ../wonderland/ wonderland

4) follow building instructions in the [main wiki](https://code.google.com/p/openwonderland/wiki/OpenWonderland?tm=6). The following should get you started:

    cd ../ # if you still are in openwonderland-modules
    cd wonderland
    ant run-server

You should have a server running that you can see at http://localhost:8080.

If you want to work with the video module or avatars, you will have to fork/clone different projects; consult the main wiki for instructions.
